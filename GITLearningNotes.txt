:::::Git Basics:::::

All files in GIT can be in three different states:

1. Modified
2. Staged(Index)
3.comitted (i.e. data is safely stored in local directory.

GIT Configuration levels:
1. System -- connfig applied to all users on a computer and all their repos
2. Global -- config applied to all repos on a comp for current users
3. Local -- config applied only to current repos


git config --global user.name "Gundeep Singh"

git init (To create an empty master branch)

Files can exist in either of the 2 states -- Tracked or Untracked.

Tracked: files that git is aware of i.e that were present in the last snapshot.
Untracked: Files that were not present in the last snapshot they are present in the working directory.

to add files in the staging area we need to use add command.

eg: git add licence.txt reademe.md

to check how many files are present in staging use :::

git status

rm -f .git/index.lock --- to delete the index.lock file and release the active lock.

git status --help (to check for all the options of commands available).
